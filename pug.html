        <h2 class="article-title">10 Things You Need To Know About Pugs</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          1. They will follow you around everywhere. If you're someone who would
          get irritated by lap dog behaviour, think twice about getting a pug.
          Whether I'm taking a quick jaunt to the kitchen or a trip to the
          bathroom, Rosie is right by my side, curly tail wagging. And then when
          I sit down, she wants to be right up on my lap. 2. They're prone to
          health problems. Pugs aren't health nightmares but "they can have a
          variety of health issues, which, if you're not familiar with, can lead
          to devastating results," says Blanche Axton, president of the board at
          Pugalug Pug Rescue in Toronto. Things to be watch for include: - eye
          scratches - food allergies - a higher-than-normal tendency to react to
          vaccines - eye- and nose-fold care - breathing problems In short, pugs
          can be high-maintenance canines. Get familiar with their health issues
          and research their breeder before you adopt Fido. 3. They need a lot
          of attention. Any dog needs your time and attention to be a happy pet,
          but many pugs require more face time than other dogs. "Because they do
          like to be with their people, they're not going to be OK just being
          left to themselves all the time," says Axton. "They are one of those
          breeds that, when you get home from work, you better be prepared to
          devote some time to them." 4. They're not couch potatoes (mostly).
          While they do enjoy naps, pugs thrive on activity, including regular
          playtime and walks. So if you work 12-hour days, find a dog walker
          because a pug can't hold its small bladder for that long. 5. They
          shed—a lot. Need proof? Come to my home and take a look at the carpet,
          couch, chairs, kitchen, clothes and bed…. "Some of the pug books says
          they are low- to medium-shed breeds," says Axton, "but some of them
          are double coated so they blow their coat in addition to shedding all
          the time." 6. They can be intrusive. Pugs are what I like to call
          "space invaders." They tend to rush up to people and other dogs, which
          can lead to a negative response. "There's a certain assumption—I think
          on most pugs' part—that every other living thing thinks they're
          fabulous," says Axton. "So they can get themselves into dicey
          situations." 7. They're smart. Just because they haven't been bred to
          be work dogs, doesn't mean pugs are stupid. Pugs can be trained just
          as easily as other dogs, including agility, scent detection, tracking
          and working with seniors. Axton recounts that she had a pug named Pete
          who, "ended up being a palliative dog, working with people who were at
          the end stages of their life." 8. They can take time to house train.
          Pugs aren't fond of inclement weather, so you may have to deal with a
          dog that refuses to go to the bathroom during a snowstorm. Take the
          time to reinforce outdoor pottying, no matter how much they resist
          going outside Sticking to a schedule will help your pug learn what he
          or she should be doing. Remember, pugs respond to positive
          reinforcement, not punishment. Pugs are motivated by food, so give
          yours a treat and lots of praise when he or she goes potty outside. 9.
          They will eat almost anything. I've seen Rosie eat sticks, gum,
          doughnuts, pasta noodles and even lollipops (wrapper included). Pugs
          are food driven and they won't give up their treat easily if you're
          trying to get them to drop it. To avoid a trip to the vet, make sure
          not to leave food lying around. 10. They're total love bugs. Once you
          get a pug, he or she will be your bestie for life. They love belly
          rubs, head scratches, giving kisses and snuggling with their human,
          and they will gaze at you as if you're the best person in the world.
          Give them the love they deserve and they will love you forever. I've
          had Rosie for two and a half years and despite her quirks, I don't
          regret having her in my life for a second. You could say she has me
          wrapped around her little paw. If you're looking to adopt or buy any
          dog, research the breed to avoid heartaches (and headaches). Head over
          to the Pug Club of Canada, recommends Axton. Come prepared with
          questions, such as what the dog's temperament is like, what kind of
          health testing they've done and if they've seen any health problems
          with the parents. "If they can't answer those questions," says Axton,
          "run away."
