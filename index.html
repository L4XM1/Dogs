            Why Are Dogs Called ‘Man’s Best Friend’?
          </h2>
          <hr class="main-article-hr" />
          <p id="p1">
            Through the ages, people have claimed dogs as one of their closest,
            and best, companions. Of all the domesticated animals, dogs serve
            the widest array of roles: protector, helper, lifesaver, and
            companion. Dogs are incredible friends to people, and they’ve been
            companions through centuries. The relationship between dogs and
            people is deep and old.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dogs and people began living together 15,000 years ago when dogs
            followed people’s migration throughout East Asia. The connection was
            natural because both people and dogs are social beings. Neither can
            thrive when alone, and both benefit mentally (and often physically)
            from strong social bonds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though domestic dogs share 99% of their DNA with wolves, dogs exude
            warmth to other dogs and humans that contrasts greatly with a wolf’s
            skeptical and defensive reaction to others. Dogs are social pack
            animals who thrive off of attention and affection, making them a
            prime candidate for a person’s best friend.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since dogs have been domesticated to a point where they need us to
            survive, and we tend to find that we need them almost as much,
            people and dogs developed a symbiotic relationship. Most dog owners
            will tell you that their dog is a family member. And having a
            faithful dog at home gives us a listening ear, a warm paw to hold,
            and even strong legs to run beside.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, the phrase “man’s best friend” originated in the American
            Supreme Court in 1870 when a talented lawyer named George Graham
            Vest defended a man who deeply loved his coon hound named Old Drum.
            Vest argued that when a neighbor killed Old Drum for trespassing,
            the neighbor took the life of more than just a pet—he killed an
            important family member. Vest famously stated, “The one absolute,
            unselfish friend that man can have in this selfish world—the one
            that never proves ungrateful or treacherous—is his dog.”
          </p>

            Dogs have proven themselves time and again to be loyal, kind,
            understanding, and have an indomitable spirit. They greet us happily
            after what may have been the worst day of our lives and make us feel
            better with a wag of their tail and a playful grin. Whether they’re
            herding sheep, hunting game, supporting people with disabilities, or
            simply acting as a companion unlike any other, dogs help humans with
            day-to-day tasks, many of which may not be possible without them.
            Dating back to the 16th century, dogs have served as service helpers
            for the blind, and by the 1970s dog trainers developed techniques
            for dogs to assist people with disabilities. As if those duties
            aren’t enough, dogs also help prevent possible crimes and save
            lives, as in the cases of drug-sniffing and bomb-sniffing canines.
            German shepherds, a 200-year-old breed, are most commonly seen
            serving as canine police all around the world.
